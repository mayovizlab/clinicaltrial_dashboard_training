# Clinical Trial Dashboard Training
Clinical Trial Dashboard Training 


## Workshop Goals

This hands-on workshop provides a tutorial of how to build a dashboard for clinical trials, specificially focusing on trials for the Radiation Oncology department. This will include summarizing accrual rates, descriptive statistics, data cleaning, adverse events, follow-up, tracking PROs and response rates. Dashboards provide study teams with a centralized, on-demand hub for visualizing key study metrics, replacing the need for ad-hoc reporting. We will introduce methods for quickly developing a dashboard using free-to-use, open-source programming environments (R/RStudio). R is a statistical and graphing-centered programming language which provides the dashboard structure, allowing integration from multiple data sources, data manipulation and analysis, and construction of visual pieces needed for communicating data to stakeholders. Participants will learn to weave together these elements, allowing for the creation of simple, elegant dashboards to track PROs and other clinical data. Participants will then learn how to deploy and share the dashboard with team members.

## Intended Audience

Beginner to intermediate programmers targeted toward statisticians and statistical programmers working with the Radiation Oncology department through the cancer center for QHS. This workshop does require some prior knowledge of statistical programming and familiarity with R or general programming principles will be helpful. Participants will be required to be part of the QHS department and have a linux account to log in to the the RStudio servers found on hsrstudio/. 

## Prework 

Please log on to the virtual meeting on the Mayo network so you can connect to the internal servers. Be sure your laptop is charged and internet connection is as stable as possible. All workshop materials are hosted on the following website: https://github.com/mayovizlab/clinictrial_dashboard_training . Please login to one of the Mayo CLinic QHS RStudio servers on hsrstudio/. Also if you are unfamiliar with R please use the internal link to review R basics. https://intranet.mayo.edu/charlie/quantitative-health-sciences-education/r/r-training-guide/

## Learning Objectives 

1. Participants will become familiar with the underlying programming (R/RStudio) techniques necessary to create a clinical dashboard. They will be given the tools to be able to load data from various sources, build visual elements, and scaffold and deploy a dashboard.
2. Participants will become familiar with the necessary free library packages that are utilized to build dashboard structure and interactivity. With these elements and our support, participants will combine these tools to create a simple dashboard to track quality-of-life protocol adherence from a blank canvas to a finished product.
3. Participants will be immersed into current real-world dashboard applications involving clinical trials, prospective registries, and retrospective dashboards. This objective will provide the participant with possible future directions and applications involving artificial intelligence, protocol lifetime management, and clinical patient tracking.
4. Participants will be equiped with the knowledge to deploy the clinical trial dashboards to the internal Posit Connect Server and how to add users.
